            <p>Hello! My name is Patrick, and welcome to my porfolio page! This page serves as a resume of sorts and will highlight a little bit about who I am and the skills that I know. I am married to my wonderful wife Debby. We live in a small town in North/Central Florida. We have two dogs and two cats. Recently, I decided that I needed a career change, which led me on this endeavor to become a web developer/software engineer. Before taking this leap I worked in criminal justice for 8 years. First as a 911 dispatcher, and then as a deputy sheriff. During those 8 years I was able to develope a few passions which you can check out below in the hobby section! If you would like to know more about me or how this endeavor is going check out my social media links and Github link below!</p>
